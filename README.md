# ABInvertForMMMCO
This is a modified texture pack for Modern Controller Overhaul compatible with Xbox controllers and the Steam Deck's controls. It inverts the A and B button icons so they function properly when action is set to down (A) and attack is set to right (B). 

## Installation
Install alongside [Modern Controller Overhaul](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/tomtee/Modern_Controller_Overhaul/). Enable Modern Controller Overhaul along with one of the packs in this mod (depends on your controller). Make sure MCO is below this mod in the list. Disable all the button texture packs that came with MCO.

In the controls section make sure your controls are set up like this image with action set to down (A) and attack set to right (B):

Finally in Modern Controller Overhaul's configuration make sure "Attack Button Position" is set to right and "Action Button Position" is set to down:

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Does this support the ROG Ally or Lenovo Legion Go's Controls?**

To my understanding both the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go use Xbox's input naming for the face buttons, shoulder buttons, and triggers so this mod pack should work perfectly with those devices when using the Xbox textures in this pack. However I don't have either of these devices so I can't confirm they'll function properly.

**Will this get a version for Dualshock controllers?**

I don't have plans for a Dualshock version currently since that would likely require more work than the Steam Deck or Xbox version due to the Dualshock controller's unique face buttons. 

**I'm using different controls and certain prompts aren't accurate. What do I do?**

Modern Controller Overhaul requires a modified texture pack when changing certain controls in order for button prompts to be accurate (which is why this mod was made). More info about that is available [here](https://github.com/t0mtee/MMModernControllerOverhaul/blob/main/TEXTURES.md).
